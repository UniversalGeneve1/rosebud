Description: # rosebud
        
        ```rosebud``` is an open-source tool for pulling CSVs into python, and immediately extracting basic statistics (mean, median, mode, quartile
        data, etc.) into variables, and has the capability of plotting these preliminary statistics via seaborn pairplots. rosebud also uses the visual capabilities of [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) to show a visual representation of the missing data within the CSVs.
        
        rosebud is currently a single-handed project, and welcomes the community for contributions.  
        
        ## Installation
        
        Current implementation will require user to download the script into the working directory, and import into script by using
        
        ```python
        from rosebud import *
        ```
        rosebud will be installable via the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager in the future.
        
        ##### Required packages:
        - os
        - numpy
        - pandas
        - matplotlib.pyplot
        - seaborn
        - [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno)
        -  warnings
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### tablesandstats()
        ```python
        tablesandstats(filepath, show_plots = 'all')
        ```
        
        rosebud's ```tablesandstats()``` function is the libraries main function that does the following:
        - Import the .csv file into your workspace, and turn the file into a DataFrame.
        - Create the statistic variables of the DataFrame, following the pattern name ```columnName_indexName```, derived from python's ```df.summary()``` function.
        - Generate a correlation matrix heatmap of the DataFrame.
        - Generate a "missing value ratio" grid for your columns, which shows what percentage of the data are null/NaN values.
        - Creates a visualization of the missing valuves via missingno's ```missingo.matrix()``` function
        
        ###### *for the following example, we will be using a file called 'Future_500'
        
        Example:
        
        calling:
        ```python
        tablesandvars("C:/Users/YourName/.../Future_500.csv")
        ```
        
        returns:

        ```python
        print(NAICS_count)

        ```
        #### tablesandstats() parameters:
        - filepath = the directory of the .csv file
        - show_plots = you can choose which specific plots are shown on screen. takes the following values: 
        
          - 'all': show all charts
          - 'none': show no charts
          - 'heatmap': show correlation grid only
          - 'completeness': show missing data visualization only
        
        ### processfolder()
        ```python
        processfolder(folderpath, show_plots = 'all')
        ```
        ```processfolder()``` is a wrapper for ```tablesandstats()``` which allows you to perform the ```tablesandstats()``` function on all .csv files in a folder. This function takes in the same parameters as ```tablesandstats()```, but expects a folder path containing the .csv files, instead of the individual file path.
        
        ### survey()
        ```python
        survey(filepath, filter_by = 'all', regress = False)
        ```
        ```survey()``` takes in the file path, normalizes data, and performs pair plotting of the features as determined by correlation grid, stratified by levels of correlation.
        The function also prints out the pairwise correlations stratification of the features. 
        
        ###### *for the following example, we will be using a file called 'data_numsOnly'
        
        Example:
          
        calling:
        ```python
        survey("C:/Users/YourName/.../data_numsOnly.csv", filter_by = 'strong_pos')
        ```
        
        returns:
        ```text
        Rosebud is surveying out the data in data numsOnly (note: graphical scale is derived from a normalized data set)
        
        !! NOTE: data numsOnly contains NaN values, which may affect true correlation value !!
        
        Strong positive correlations:
        
        [['Establishments' 'Average Employment']
         ['Establishments' 'Total Wage']

        Weak positive correlations:
        
        [['NAICS' 'Year']]
        
        Features with no correlations:

         ['NAICS' 'Average Employment']
         ['NAICS' 'Total Wage']
         ['NAICS' 'Annual Average Salary']

         ['Total Wage' 'Annual Average Salary']
         ['Total Wage' 'Years Active']
         ['Annual Average Salary' 'Years Active']]
        
        Weak Negative correlations:
        
        [['NAICS' 'Years Active']]

        #### survey() parameters:
        - filepath = the directory of the .csv file
        - filter_by = select the stata of correlation you want plotted:
          - 'all' = plot all correlations (note: large datasets will take a long time for visualization)
          - 'strong_pos' = strong positive correlation
          - 'weak_pos' = weak positive correlation
          - 'no_corr' No correlation
          - 'weak_neg' = weak negative correlation
          - 'strong_neg' = strong negative correlation
        
        - regress = include a best-fit line to the pairplots
